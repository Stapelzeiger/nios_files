nios_files
==========

All the binary blobs (urgh) generated by Quartus II to run the hardware.

We are currently in the process of opensourcing the HDL files, because we know
that a binary blog is useless to anyone but us.

So for now, here is a little summary of what is in this package :
* FPGA.sof : This file is used to flash the SDRAM of the FPGA (holds until reset).
* FPGA.jic : Used to program the flash.
* NIOS.sopcinfo : Contains the description of the system, for the toolchain.
* fifoed_avalon_uart.zip : Contains all the files used for the FIFOed UART (drivers and hardware files).
